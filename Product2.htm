<b>Undertale</b> UNDERTALE! The RPG Game where you dont have to destroy anyone!
<br>
<b>Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever.

<br>
features:

Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.
Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.
Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality.
Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.
Created mostly by one person.
Become friends with all of the bosses!
At least 5 dogs.
You can date a skeleton.
Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...?
Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton.
I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog.
If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.<br>
 <em> Price:15$
